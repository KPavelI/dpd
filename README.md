# dpd

Dissiaptive particle dynamics.

2D domain decomposition realization.

You should compile single file and modify dpdconf.dat as you wish.
In this implementation PBC works only for the solvent particles (type 4 - N), grid particles are not moving (type 3 - P), chain particles can not penetrate outside the box (type 1 - O and 2 - S).
